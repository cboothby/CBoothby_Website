<p id="head">About Me</p>

<br>
<p id="about">My name is Charles Boothby, most friends call me Charlie. I am a Digital Arts and Sciences major at the University of Florida. I have enjoyed working with a great group of students and faculty to make various projects and expand my skills. While I have found 3D animation to be the most enjoyable, I love working in several subjects such as 2D animation, video editing, production, coding, and game design. I have learned a lot and very much enjoyed all of my personal projects. However, in my experience, group projects have been the most fun with the best outcome. My ideas flourish when they are inspired by and/or bounced off others.</p>
